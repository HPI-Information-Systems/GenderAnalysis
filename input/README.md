# GenderAnalysis Input

These input files are the basis for our 2021 SIGMOD Record
[publication](https://sigmodrecord.org/2021/12/31/how-inclusive-are-we-an-analysis-of-gender-diversity-in-database-venues/)
"How Inclusive are We? An Analysis of Gender Diversity in Database Venues" (Angela Bonifati, Michael J. Mior, Felix 
Naumann, Nele Sina Noack). 
We obtained these input files with the use of [dblp-retriever](https://github.com/nenock/dblp-retriever) which is 
soon going to be installed as a submodule in this repository.
